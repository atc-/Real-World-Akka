It's easy. Your interface is `tell` and you give it messages. It's that simple. Implement your actors\r\nthrough their tests, following the \"Test. Code. Refactor.\" mantra. You will fail to reason correctly if you can't\r\ndocument the actor's input/output through tests and the larger system gets the harder it will be to reason.\r\n\r\n## Patterns\r\n\r\n### Cameo \r\n\r\n### Anonymous Worker\r\n\r\n### \"If In Doubt, Push It Out\"\r\n\r\n# Testing Actor Systems\r\n\r\n## The One Rule\r\n\r\nYes, this bit's repeated. It's that important: \r\n\r\n> Test first. It's easy. Your interface is `tell` and you give it messages. It's that simple. Implement your actors\r\n> through their tests, following the \"Test. Code. Refactor.\" mantra. You will fail to reason correctly if you can't\r\n> document the actor's input/output through tests and the larger system gets the harder it will be to reason.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
